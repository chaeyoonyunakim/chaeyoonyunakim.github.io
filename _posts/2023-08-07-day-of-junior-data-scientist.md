Good afternoon from London :wave:

## Who am I?

I am a Data Scientist with 2 years of professional experience in Machine Learning, Data analysis and visualization, possessing a wide range of technical skills in programming, data science, cloud computing, and project management.

**Keywords:** `Visual Analytics`, `Statistical Data Analytics`, `Data Management` <br>

**Technical Skills:**

```
- Programming: Python, R, SQL, MATLAB
- Data Science: Pandas, Numpy, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Tableau, QGIS, Google Analytics
- Cloud Computing: Databricks, GCP, Azure + Data Lake
- Others: Git, Trello, LaTeX, MS Office tools, Jira
- Interests and Learning: Software development (Agile), Open-source contribution
```

**Professional demeanor:**

## Moves towards real-world problems; navigating skill emphases

After completing my postgraduate studies in 2021, I worked for further academic achievements and early career experiences such as writting a paper, assisting a textbook publication, and taking on the role of a lead instructor to teach programming. Since I transitioned into public healthcare, I have been involved in several projects spanning various NHS organizations and Trust sites. That gaves me positive evaluations during my lastest appraisal.

The table below provides a convenient comparison, illustraing how my master's assessments and work projects distribute emphasis among different skills and tasks related to `data processing`, `programming`, `review`, and `report/visualization`.

|                  | Data processing | Programming | Review   | Report/Viz |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------- |
| MSc Data Science | **-**           | **70%**     | **20%**  | **10%**    |
| Project A        | 50%             | 30%         | 10%      | 10%        |
| Project B        | 95%             | 5%          | -        | -          |
| Project C        | 5%              | 65%         | 30%      | -          |
| **Average(ABC)** | **50%**         | **~30%**    | **<15%** | **<5%**    |

Whilst `programming` can include `data processing`, I primarily used robust datasets during my academic year. For the other cases, I found that loading the semi-structured data such as JSON (obtained from APIs) or unstructured data like images or WhatsApp text required more programming foundations for data processing. That's why I choose to mark the <mark style="background-color: Cornsilk">full credits in solo programming during the master's programme</mark>.

At work, I sometimes had a strategic decision not to handle the `review` or `reporting part` of that specific project as stated in the table. This choice was agreed within the team. When other priorities required my immediate attention, I was able to pass all my model ideas and findings (with my thanks) to the other contributors who were working on the same project. That is certainly different from how I used to carry my own responsibilities for the university courseworks; <mark style="background-color: Cornsilk">the team needs me for team-work!</mark>

These differences highlight how an individual's tech skill requirements to meet task commitments vary in terms of their collaborative level, especially the more if working in the wider group.

## Why 50% in data processing?
